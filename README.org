* Ethics
The information you find on the website isn't all mine, however has been checked

- Product Trademarks ::
  This programs demonstration database contains products whose names are under
  trademark. This is acceptable in this case as it neither dilutes, defames or
  misrepresents the products in question, legally speaking I do not need to
  consult the companies to use the product trademarks in my work, provided I use
  the trademarks respectfully.

The project contains two parts, the database and the web server code. The

This is plugged into a web server that serves the available products to browse
and search. The entire web server, including served html, is written in Common
Lisp. The reason for this is because Lisp gives me greater flexibility and
control over the served data and the[[http://weitz.de/cl-who/][ cl-who]] package gives great power with
respect to HTML. The[[https://github.com/slime/slime.git][ Slime]] REPL also allows the ability to change aspects of the
server without shutting off or requiring complex monkey patching.
** Backend design
The backend has been thoroughly planned and tested.
