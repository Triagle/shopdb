The project contains two parts, the database and the web server code. The
database backend is a simple sqlite server that follows the following schema

This is plugged into a web server that serves the available products to browse
and search. The entire web server, including served html, is written in Common
Lisp. The reason for this is because Lisp gives me greater flexibility and
control over the served data and the[[http://weitz.de/cl-who/][ cl-who]] package gives great power with
respect to HTML. The[[https://github.com/slime/slime.git][ Slime]] REPL also allows the ability to change aspects of the
server without shutting off or requiring complex monkey patching.
** Backend design
The backend has been thoroughly planned and tested.
